\title{Projection predictive feature selection}
\description{
The \R package \pkg{projpred} performs the projection predictive variable (or
"feature") selection for various regression models. We recommend to read the
\code{README} file (available with enhanced formatting
\href{https://mc-stan.org/projpred/}{online}) and the main vignette (\code{topic = "projpred"}, but also available
\href{https://mc-stan.org/projpred/articles/projpred.html}{online}) before
continuing here.
}
\section{Terminology}{
Throughout the whole package documentation, we use the term "submodel" for
all kinds of candidate models onto which the reference model is projected.
For custom reference models, the candidate models don't need to be actual
\emph{sub}models of the reference model, but in any case (even for custom
reference models), the candidate models are always actual \emph{sub}models of the
full \code{\link{formula}} used by the search procedure. In this regard, it is correct
to speak of \emph{sub}models, even in case of a custom reference model.

The following model type abbreviations will be used at multiple places
throughout the documentation: GLM (generalized linear model), GLMM
(generalized linear multilevel---or "mixed"---model), GAM (generalized
additive model), and GAMM (generalized additive multilevel---or
"mixed"---model). Note that the term "generalized" includes the Gaussian
family as well.
}

\section{Draw-wise divergence minimizers}{
For the projection of the reference model onto a submodel, \pkg{projpred}
currently relies on the following functions as draw-wise divergence
minimizers (in other words, these are the workhorse functions employed by
\pkg{projpred}'s internal default \code{div_minimizer} functions, see
\code{\link[=init_refmodel]{init_refmodel()}}):
\itemize{
\item Submodel without multilevel or additive terms:
\itemize{
\item For the traditional (or latent) projection (or the augmented-data
projection in case of the \code{\link[=binomial]{binomial()}} or \code{\link[brms:brmsfamily]{brms::bernoulli()}} family): An
internal C++ function which basically serves the same purpose as \code{\link[=lm]{lm()}}
for the \code{\link[=gaussian]{gaussian()}} family and \code{\link[=glm]{glm()}} for all other families. The
returned object inherits from class \code{subfit}. Possible tuning parameters
for this internal C++ function are: \code{regul} (amount of ridge
regularization; default: \code{1e-4}), \code{thresh_conv} (convergence threshold;
default: \code{1e-7}), \code{qa_updates_max} (maximum number of quadratic
approximation updates; default: \code{100}, but fixed to \code{1} in case of the
Gaussian family with identity link), \code{ls_iter_max} (maximum number of
line search iterations; default: \code{30}, but fixed to \code{1} in case of the
Gaussian family with identity link), \code{normalize} (single logical value
indicating whether to scale the predictors internally with the returned
regression coefficient estimates being back-adjusted appropriately;
default: \code{TRUE}), \code{beta0_init} (single numeric value giving the starting
value for the intercept at centered predictors; default: \code{0}), and
\code{beta_init} (numeric vector giving the starting values for the regression
coefficients; default: vector of \code{0}s).
\item For the augmented-data projection: \code{\link[MASS:polr]{MASS::polr()}} (the returned object
inherits from class \code{polr}) for the \code{\link[brms:brmsfamily]{brms::cumulative()}} family or
\code{\link[rstanarm:stan_polr]{rstanarm::stan_polr()}} fits, \code{\link[nnet:multinom]{nnet::multinom()}} (the returned object
inherits from class \code{multinom}) for the \code{\link[brms:brmsfamily]{brms::categorical()}} family.
}
\item Submodel with multilevel but no additive terms:
\itemize{
\item For the traditional (or latent) projection (or the augmented-data
projection in case of the \code{\link[=binomial]{binomial()}} or \code{\link[brms:brmsfamily]{brms::bernoulli()}} family):
\code{\link[lme4:lmer]{lme4::lmer()}} (the returned object inherits from class \code{lmerMod}) for
the \code{\link[=gaussian]{gaussian()}} family, \code{\link[lme4:glmer]{lme4::glmer()}} (the returned object inherits
from class \code{glmerMod}) for all other families.
\item For the augmented-data projection: \code{\link[ordinal:clmm]{ordinal::clmm()}} (the returned
object inherits from class \code{clmm}) for the \code{\link[brms:brmsfamily]{brms::cumulative()}} family,
\code{\link[mclogit:mblogit]{mclogit::mblogit()}} (the returned object inherits from class \code{mmblogit})
for the \code{\link[brms:brmsfamily]{brms::categorical()}} family.
}
\item Submodel without multilevel but additive terms: \code{\link[mgcv:gam]{mgcv::gam()}} (the returned
object inherits from class \code{gam}).
\item Submodel with multilevel and additive terms: \code{\link[gamm4:gamm4]{gamm4::gamm4()}} (within
\pkg{projpred}, the returned object inherits from class \code{gamm4}).
}
}

\section{Verbosity, messages, warnings, errors}{
Global option \code{projpred.verbose} may be used for specifying the value passed
to argument \code{verbose} of \code{\link[=project]{project()}}, \code{\link[=varsel]{varsel()}}, and \code{\link[=cv_varsel]{cv_varsel()}}.

By default, \pkg{projpred} catches messages and warnings from the draw-wise
divergence minimizers and throws their unique collection after performing all
draw-wise divergence minimizations (i.e., draw-wise projections). This can be
deactivated by setting global option \code{projpred.warn_proj_drawwise} to
\code{FALSE}.

Furthermore, by default, \pkg{projpred} checks the convergence of the
draw-wise divergence minimizers and throws a warning if any seem to have not
converged. This warning is thrown after the warning message from global
option \code{projpred.warn_proj_drawwise} (see above) and can be deactivated by
setting global option \code{projpred.check_convergence} to \code{FALSE}.
}

\section{Parallelization}{
The projection of the reference model onto a submodel can be run in parallel
(across the projected draws). This is powered by the \pkg{foreach} package.
Thus, any parallel (or sequential) backend compatible with \pkg{foreach} can
be used, e.g., the backends from packages \pkg{doParallel}, \pkg{doMPI}, or
\pkg{doFuture}. Using the global option \code{projpred.prll_prj_trigger}, the
number of projected draws below which no parallelization is applied (even if
a parallel backend is registered) can be modified. Such a "trigger" threshold
exists because of the computational overhead of a parallelization which makes
the projection parallelization only useful for a sufficiently large number of
projected draws. By default, the projection parallelization is turned off,
which can also be achieved by supplying \code{Inf} (or \code{NULL}) to option
\code{projpred.prll_prj_trigger}. Note that we cannot recommend the projection
parallelization on Windows because in our experience, the parallelization
overhead is larger there, causing a parallel run to take longer than a
sequential run. Also note that the projection parallelization works well for
submodels which are GLMs (and hence also for the latent projection if the
submodel has no multilevel or additive predictor terms), but for all other
types of submodels, the fitted submodel objects are quite big, which---when
running in parallel---may lead to excessive memory usage which in turn may
crash the R session (on Unix systems, setting an appropriate memory limit via
\code{\link[unix:rlimit]{unix::rlimit_as()}} may avoid crashing the whole machine). Thus, we currently
cannot recommend parallelizing projections onto submodels which are GLMs (in
this context, the latent projection onto a submodel without multilevel and
without additive terms may be regarded as a projection onto a submodel which
is a GLM). However, for \code{\link[=cv_varsel]{cv_varsel()}}, there is also a \emph{CV} parallelization
(i.e., a parallelization of \pkg{projpred}'s cross-validation) which can be
activated via argument \code{parallel} (which in turn can be controlled via global
option \code{projpred.parallel_cv}).

For the CV parallelization, global option \code{projpred.export_to_workers} may be
set to a character vector of names of objects to export from the global
environment to the parallel workers.

During parallelization (either of the projection or the CV), progression
updates can be received via the \pkg{progressr} package. This only works if
the \pkg{doFuture} backend is used for parallelization, e.g., via
\code{doFuture::registerDoFuture()} and \code{future::plan(future::multisession, workers = 4)}. In that case, the \pkg{progressr} package can be used, e.g.,
by calling \code{progressr::handlers(global = TRUE)} before running the projection
or the CV in parallel. The \pkg{projpred} package also offers the global
option \code{projpred.use_progressr} for controlling whether to use the
\pkg{progressr} package (\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}), but since that global option
defaults to \code{requireNamespace("progressr", quietly = TRUE) && interactive() && identical(foreach::getDoParName(), "doFuture")}, it usually does not need
to be set by the user.
}

\section{Multilevel models: "Integrating out" group-level effects}{
In case of multilevel models, \pkg{projpred} offers two global options for
"integrating out" group-level effects: \code{projpred.mlvl_pred_new} and
\code{projpred.mlvl_proj_ref_new}. When setting \code{projpred.mlvl_pred_new} to \code{TRUE}
(default is \code{FALSE}), then at
\emph{prediction} time, \pkg{projpred} will treat group levels existing in the
training data as \emph{new} group levels, implying that their group-level effects
are drawn randomly from a (multivariate) Gaussian distribution. This concerns
both, the reference model and the (i.e., any) submodel. Furthermore, setting
\code{projpred.mlvl_pred_new} to \code{TRUE} causes \code{\link[=as.matrix.projection]{as.matrix.projection()}} and
\code{\link[=as_draws_matrix.projection]{as_draws_matrix.projection()}} to omit the projected group-level effects (for
the group levels from the original dataset). When setting
\code{projpred.mlvl_proj_ref_new} to \code{TRUE} (default is \code{FALSE}), then at
\emph{projection} time, the reference model's fitted values (that the submodels
fit to) will be computed by treating the group levels from the original
dataset as \emph{new} group levels, implying that their group-level effects will
be drawn randomly from a (multivariate) Gaussian distribution (as long as the
reference model is a multilevel model, which---for custom reference
models---does not need to be the case). This also affects the latent response
values for a latent projection correspondingly. Setting
\code{projpred.mlvl_pred_new} to \code{TRUE} makes sense, e.g., when the prediction
task is such that any group level will be treated as a new one. Typically,
setting \code{projpred.mlvl_proj_ref_new} to \code{TRUE} only makes sense when
\code{projpred.mlvl_pred_new} is already set to \code{TRUE}. In that case, the default
of \code{FALSE} for \code{projpred.mlvl_proj_ref_new} ensures that at projection time,
the submodels fit to the best possible fitted values from the reference
model, and setting \code{projpred.mlvl_proj_ref_new} to \code{TRUE} would make sense if
the group-level effects should be integrated out completely.
}

\section{Memory usage}{
By setting the global option \code{projpred.run_gc} to \code{TRUE}, \pkg{projpred} will
call \code{\link[=gc]{gc()}} at some places (e.g., after each size that the forward search
passes through) to free up some memory. These \code{\link[=gc]{gc()}} calls are not always
necessary to reduce the peak memory usage, but they add runtime (hence the
default of \code{FALSE} for that global option).

Most examples are not executed when called via \code{\link[=example]{example()}}. To execute them,
their code has to be copied and pasted manually to the console.
