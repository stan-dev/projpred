\arguments{
\item{object}{Either a \code{refmodel}-type object created by
\link[=init_refmodel]{init_refmodel}, an object which can be converted to a
reference model using \link[=get_refmodel]{get_refmodel}, or a \code{vsel}
object resulting from \code{varsel} or \code{cv_varsel}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to the \code{get_refmodel}
function.}

\item{d_test}{A test dataset which is used to evaluate model performance. If
not provided, training data is used. Currently this argument is for
internal use only.}

\item{method}{The search method, i.e. the method for finding a single
submodel per number of terms. Possible options are \code{"L1"} for L1
search and \code{"forward"} for forward search. Default is \code{"forward"}
if the reference model has multilevel or additive terms and \code{"L1"}
otherwise.}

\item{ndraws}{Number of posterior draws used in the variable selection.
Cannot be larger than the number of draws in the reference model.
\strong{Caution:} For \code{ndraws <= 20}, the value of \code{ndraws} is
passed to \code{nclusters} (so that clustering is used). Ignored if
\code{nclusters} is not \code{NULL} or if \code{method = "L1"} (L1 search
uses always one cluster). See also section "Details" below.}

\item{nclusters}{Number of clusters of posterior draws used in the variable
selection. Ignored if \code{method = "L1"} (L1 search uses always one
cluster). For the meaning of \code{NULL}, see argument \code{ndraws}. See
also section "Details" below.}

\item{ndraws_pred}{Number of posterior draws used for prediction (after
selection). Cannot be larger than the number of draws in the reference
model. \strong{Caution:} For \code{ndraws_pred <= 20}, the value of
\code{ndraws_pred} is passed to \code{nclusters_pred} (so that clustering
is used). Ignored if \code{nclusters_pred} is not \code{NULL}. See also
section "Details" below.}

\item{nclusters_pred}{Number of clusters of posterior draws used for
prediction (after selection). For the meaning of \code{NULL}, see argument
\code{ndraws_pred}. See also section "Details" below.}

\item{cv_search}{If \code{TRUE}, then the projected coefficients after an L1
search are computed without any penalization (or using only the
regularization determined by \code{regul}). If \code{FALSE}, then the
coefficients are the solution from the L1-penalized projection. This option
is relevant only if \code{method = "L1"}. Default is \code{TRUE} for
genuine reference models and \code{FALSE} if \code{object} is datafit (see
\link[=init_refmodel]{init_refmodel}).}

\item{nterms_max}{Maximum number of variables until which the selection is
continued. Defaults to \code{min(19, D)} where \code{D} is the number of
terms in the reference model (or in \code{search_terms}, if supplied). Note
that \code{nterms_max} does not count the intercept, so use
\code{nterms_max = 0} for the intercept-only model.}

\item{verbose}{A single logical value indicating whether to print out
additional information while running (\code{TRUE}) or not (\code{FALSE}).}

\item{lambda_min_ratio}{Ratio between the smallest and largest lambda in the
L1-penalized search. This parameter essentially determines how long the
search is carried out, i.e., how large submodels are explored. No need to
change the default value unless the program gives a warning about this.}

\item{nlambda}{Number of values in the lambda grid for L1-penalized search.
No need to change unless the program gives a warning about this.}

\item{thresh}{Convergence threshold when computing the L1 path. Usually,
there is no need to change this.}

\item{regul}{Amount of regularization in the projection. Usually there is no
need for regularization, but sometimes for some models the projection can
be ill-behaved and we need to add some regularization to avoid numerical
problems.}

\item{penalty}{Vector determining the relative penalties or costs for the
variables. A value of \code{0} means that those variables have no cost and
will therefore be selected first, whereas \code{Inf} means those variables
will never be selected. Currently works only if \code{method = "L1"}. By
default \code{1} for each variable.}

\item{search_terms}{A custom character vector of terms to consider for
selection. The intercept (\code{"1"}) needs to be included explicitly. The
default considers all the terms in the reference model's formula.}

\item{seed}{Random seed used when clustering the posterior draws.}
}
\value{
An object of type \code{vsel} that contains information about the
feature selection. The fields are not meant to be accessed directly by the
user but instead via the helper functions (see the vignettes or type
\code{?projpred} to see the main functions in the package).
}
\description{
Perform the projection predictive variable selection for generalized linear
models, generalized linear and additive multilevel models using generic
reference models.
}
\details{
Using less draws or clusters in \code{ndraws}, \code{nclusters},
\code{nclusters_pred}, or \code{ndraws_pred} than posterior draws in the
reference model may result in slightly inaccurate projection performance.
Increasing these arguments linearly affects the computation time.
