\title{Predictor terms used in a \code{\link[=project]{project()}} run}
\usage{
predictor_terms(object, ...)

\method{predictor_terms}{projection}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{projection} (returned by \code{\link[=project]{project()}},
possibly as elements of a \code{list}) from which to retrieve the predictor
terms.}

\item{...}{Currently ignored.}
}
\value{
A character vector of predictor terms.
}
\description{
For a \code{projection} object (returned by \code{\link[=project]{project()}}, possibly as elements of a
\code{list}), this function extracts the combination of predictor terms onto which
the projection was performed.
