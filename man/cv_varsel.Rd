\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{refmodel} (returned by \code{\link[=get_refmodel]{get_refmodel()}} or
\code{\link[=init_refmodel]{init_refmodel()}}) or an object that can be passed to argument \code{object} of
\code{\link[=get_refmodel]{get_refmodel()}}.}

\item{...}{For \code{\link[=cv_varsel.default]{cv_varsel.default()}}: Arguments passed to \code{\link[=get_refmodel]{get_refmodel()}} as
well as to \code{\link[=cv_varsel.refmodel]{cv_varsel.refmodel()}}. For \code{\link[=cv_varsel.vsel]{cv_varsel.vsel()}}: Arguments passed
to \code{\link[=cv_varsel.refmodel]{cv_varsel.refmodel()}}. For \code{\link[=cv_varsel.refmodel]{cv_varsel.refmodel()}}: Arguments passed to
the divergence minimizer (see argument \code{div_minimizer} of \code{\link[=init_refmodel]{init_refmodel()}}
as well as section "Draw-wise divergence minimizers" of \link{projpred-package})
when refitting the submodels for the performance evaluation (if \code{refit_prj}
is \code{TRUE}).}

\item{cv_method}{The CV method, either \code{"LOO"} or \code{"kfold"}. In the \code{"LOO"}
case, a Pareto-smoothed importance sampling leave-one-out CV (PSIS-LOO-CV)
is performed, which avoids refitting the reference model \code{nloo} times (in
contrast to a standard LOO-CV). In the \code{"kfold"} case, a \eqn{K}-fold-CV is
performed. See also section "Note" below.}

\item{nloo}{Only relevant if \code{cv_method = "LOO"} and \code{validate_search = TRUE}. If \code{nloo > 0} is smaller than the number of all observations, full
LOO-CV (i.e., PSIS-LOO CV with \code{validate_search = TRUE} and with \code{nloo = n}
where \code{n} denotes the number of all observations) is approximated by
subsampled LOO-CV, i.e., by combining the fast (i.e., \code{validate_search = FALSE}) LOO result for the selected models and \code{nloo} leave-one-out
searches using the difference estimator with simple random sampling (SRS)
without replacement (WOR) (Magnusson et al., 2020). Smaller \code{nloo} values
lead to faster computation, but higher uncertainty in the evaluation part.
If \code{NULL}, all observations are used (as by default). Note that performance
statistic \code{"auc"} (see argument \code{stats} of \code{\link[=summary.vsel]{summary.vsel()}} and
\code{\link[=plot.vsel]{plot.vsel()}}) is not supported in case of subsampled LOO-CV. Furthermore,
option \code{"best"} for argument \code{baseline} of \code{\link[=summary.vsel]{summary.vsel()}} and
\code{\link[=plot.vsel]{plot.vsel()}} is not supported in case of subsampled LOO-CV.}

\item{K}{Only relevant if \code{cv_method = "kfold"} and if \code{cvfits} is \code{NULL}
(which is the case for reference model objects created by
\code{\link[=get_refmodel.stanreg]{get_refmodel.stanreg()}} or \code{\link[brms:get_refmodel.brmsfit]{brms::get_refmodel.brmsfit()}}). Number of
folds in \eqn{K}-fold-CV.}

\item{cvfits}{Only relevant if \code{cv_method = "kfold"}. The same as argument
\code{cvfits} of \code{\link[=init_refmodel]{init_refmodel()}}, but repeated here so that output from
\code{\link[=run_cvfun]{run_cvfun()}} can be inserted here straightforwardly.}

\item{validate_search}{A single logical value indicating whether to
cross-validate also the search part, i.e., whether to run the search
separately for each CV fold (\code{TRUE}) or not (\code{FALSE}). With \code{FALSE},
the computation is faster, but the predictive performance estimates
of the selected submodels are optimistically biased. However, these fast
biased estimates can be useful to obtain initial information on the
usefulness of projection predictive variable selection.}

\item{method}{The method for the search part. Possible options are
\code{"forward"} for forward search and \code{"L1"} for L1 search. See also section
"Details" below.}

\item{ndraws}{Number of posterior draws used in the search part. Ignored if
\code{nclusters} is not \code{NULL} or in case of L1 search (because L1 search always
uses a single cluster). If both (\code{nclusters} and \code{ndraws}) are \code{NULL}, the
number of posterior draws from the reference model is used for \code{ndraws}.
See also section "Details" below.}

\item{nclusters}{Number of clusters of posterior draws used in the search
part. Ignored in case of L1 search (because L1 search always uses a single
cluster). For the meaning of \code{NULL}, see argument \code{ndraws}. See also
section "Details" below.}

\item{ndraws_pred}{Only relevant if \code{refit_prj} is \code{TRUE}. Number of
posterior draws used in the evaluation part. Ignored if \code{nclusters_pred} is
not \code{NULL}. If both (\code{nclusters_pred} and \code{ndraws_pred}) are \code{NULL}, the
number of posterior draws from the reference model is used for
\code{ndraws_pred}. See also section "Details" below.}

\item{nclusters_pred}{Only relevant if \code{refit_prj} is \code{TRUE}. Number of
clusters of posterior draws used in the evaluation part. For the meaning of
\code{NULL}, see argument \code{ndraws_pred}. See also section "Details" below.}

\item{refit_prj}{For the evaluation part, should the projections onto the
submodels along the predictor ranking be performed again using \code{ndraws_pred}
draws or \code{nclusters_pred} clusters (\code{TRUE}) or should their projections from
the search part, which used \code{ndraws} draws or \code{nclusters} clusters, be re-used
(\code{FALSE})?}

\item{nterms_max}{Maximum submodel size (number of predictor terms) up to
which the search is continued. If \code{NULL}, then \code{min(19, D)} is used where
\code{D} is the number of terms in the reference model (or in \code{search_terms}, if
supplied). Note that \code{nterms_max} does not count the intercept, so use
\code{nterms_max = 0} for the intercept-only model. (Correspondingly, \code{D} above
does not count the intercept.)}

\item{penalty}{Only relevant for L1 search. A numeric vector determining the
relative penalties or costs for the predictors. A value of \code{0} means that
those predictors have no cost and will therefore be selected first, whereas
\code{Inf} means those predictors will never be selected. If \code{NULL}, then \code{1} is
used for each predictor.}

\item{verbose}{A single integer value from the set \eqn{\{0, 1, 2, 3,
  4\}}{{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}} (for \code{\link[=varsel]{varsel()}}, \eqn{3} and \eqn{4} have the same
effect), indicating how much information (if any) to print out during the
computations. Higher values indicate that more information should be
printed, \code{0} deactivates the verbose mode. Internally, argument \code{verbose}
is coerced to integer via \code{as.integer()}, so technically, a single logical
value or a single numeric value work as well.}

\item{search_control}{A \code{list} of "control" arguments (i.e., tuning
parameters) for the search. In case of forward search, these arguments are
passed to the divergence minimizer (see argument \code{div_minimizer} of
\code{\link[=init_refmodel]{init_refmodel()}} as well as section "Draw-wise divergence minimizers" of
\link{projpred-package}). In case of forward search, \code{NULL} causes \code{...} to be
used not only for the performance evaluation, but also for the search. In
case of L1 search, possible arguments are:
\itemize{
\item \code{lambda_min_ratio}: Ratio between the smallest and largest lambda in the
L1-penalized search (default: \code{1e-5}). This parameter essentially
determines how long the search is carried out, i.e., how large submodels
are explored. No need to change this unless the program gives a warning
about this.
\item \code{nlambda}: Number of values in the lambda grid for L1-penalized search
(default: \code{150}). No need to change this unless the program gives a warning
about this.
\item \code{thresh}: Convergence threshold when computing the L1 path (default:
\code{1e-6}). Usually, there is no need to change this.
}}

\item{lambda_min_ratio}{Deprecated (please use \code{search_control} instead).
Only relevant for L1 search. Ratio between the smallest and largest lambda
in the L1-penalized search. This parameter essentially determines how long
the search is carried out, i.e., how large submodels are explored. No need
to change this unless the program gives a warning about this.}

\item{nlambda}{Deprecated (please use \code{search_control} instead). Only
relevant for L1 search. Number of values in the lambda grid for
L1-penalized search. No need to change this unless the program gives a
warning about this.}

\item{thresh}{Deprecated (please use \code{search_control} instead). Only relevant
for L1 search. Convergence threshold when computing the L1 path. Usually,
there is no need to change this.}

\item{seed}{Pseudorandom number generation (PRNG) seed by which the same
results can be obtained again if needed. Passed to argument \code{seed} of
\code{\link[=set.seed]{set.seed()}}, but can also be \code{NA} to not call \code{\link[=set.seed]{set.seed()}} at all. If not
\code{NA}, then the PRNG state is reset (to the state before calling
\code{\link[=cv_varsel]{cv_varsel()}}) upon exiting \code{\link[=cv_varsel]{cv_varsel()}}. Here, \code{seed} is used for
clustering the reference model's posterior draws (if \code{!is.null(nclusters)}
or \code{!is.null(nclusters_pred)}), for subsampling PSIS-LOO-CV folds (if
\code{nloo} is smaller than the number of observations), for sampling the folds
in \eqn{K}-fold-CV, and for drawing new group-level effects when predicting
from a multilevel submodel (however, not yet in case of a GAMM).}

\item{search_terms}{Only relevant for forward search. A custom character
vector of predictor term blocks to consider for the search. Section
"Details" below describes more precisely what "predictor term block" means.
The intercept (\code{"1"}) is always included internally via \code{union()}, so
there's no difference between including it explicitly or omitting it. The
default \code{search_terms} considers all the terms in the reference model's
formula.}

\item{search_out}{Intended for internal use.}

\item{parallel}{A single logical value indicating whether to run costly parts
of the CV in parallel (\code{TRUE}) or not (\code{FALSE}). See also section "Note"
below as well as section "Parallelization" in \link{projpred-package}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{vsel}. The elements of this object are not meant
to be accessed directly but instead via helper functions (see the main
vignette and \link{projpred-package}).
}
\description{
Run the \emph{search} part and the \emph{evaluation} part for a projection predictive
variable selection. The search part determines the predictor ranking (also
known as solution path), i.e., the best submodel for each submodel size
(number of predictor terms). The evaluation part determines the predictive
performance of the submodels along the predictor ranking. In contrast to
\code{\link[=varsel]{varsel()}}, \code{\link[=cv_varsel]{cv_varsel()}} performs a cross-validation (CV) by running the
search part with the training data of each CV fold separately (an exception
is explained in section "Note" below) and by running the evaluation part on
the corresponding test set of each CV fold. A special method is
\code{\link[=cv_varsel.vsel]{cv_varsel.vsel()}} because it re-uses the search results from an earlier
\code{\link[=cv_varsel]{cv_varsel()}} (or \code{\link[=varsel]{varsel()}}) run, as illustrated in the main vignette.
}
\details{
Arguments \code{ndraws}, \code{nclusters}, \code{nclusters_pred}, and \code{ndraws_pred}
are automatically truncated at the number of posterior draws in the
reference model (which is \code{1} for \code{datafit}s). Using less draws or clusters
in \code{ndraws}, \code{nclusters}, \code{nclusters_pred}, or \code{ndraws_pred} than posterior
draws in the reference model may result in slightly inaccurate projection
performance. Increasing these arguments affects the computation time
linearly.

For argument \code{method}, there are some restrictions: For a reference model
with multilevel or additive formula terms or a reference model set up for
the augmented-data projection, only the forward search is available.
Furthermore, argument \code{search_terms} requires a forward search to take
effect.

L1 search is faster than forward search, but forward search may be more
accurate. Furthermore, forward search may find a sparser model with
comparable performance to that found by L1 search, but it may also
overfit when more predictors are added. This overfit can be detected
by running search validation (see \code{\link[=cv_varsel]{cv_varsel()}}).

An L1 search may select an interaction term before all involved lower-order
interaction terms (including main-effect terms) have been selected. In
\pkg{projpred} versions > 2.6.0, the resulting predictor ranking is
automatically modified so that the lower-order interaction terms come
before this interaction term, but if this is conceptually undesired, choose
the forward search instead.

The elements of the \code{search_terms} character vector don't need to be
individual predictor terms. Instead, they can be building blocks consisting
of several predictor terms connected by the \code{+} symbol. To understand how
these building blocks work, it is important to know how \pkg{projpred}'s
forward search works: It starts with an empty vector \code{chosen} which will
later contain already selected predictor terms. Then, the search iterates
over model sizes \eqn{j \in \{0, ..., J\}}{j = 0, ..., J} (with \eqn{J}
denoting the maximum submodel size, not counting the intercept). The
candidate models at model size \eqn{j} are constructed from those elements
from \code{search_terms} which yield model size \eqn{j} when combined with the
\code{chosen} predictor terms. Note that sometimes, there may be no candidate
models for model size \eqn{j}. Also note that internally, \code{search_terms} is
expanded to include the intercept (\code{"1"}), so the first step of the search
(model size 0) always consists of the intercept-only model as the only
candidate.

As a \code{search_terms} example, consider a reference model with formula \code{y ~ x1 + x2 + x3}. Then, to ensure that \code{x1} is always included in the
candidate models, specify \code{search_terms = c("x1", "x1 + x2", "x1 + x3", "x1 + x2 + x3")} (or, in a simpler way that leads to the same results,
\code{search_terms = c("x1", "x1 + x2", "x1 + x3")}, for which helper function
\code{\link[=force_search_terms]{force_search_terms()}} exists). This search would start with \code{y ~ 1} as the
only candidate at model size 0. At model size 1, \code{y ~ x1} would be the only
candidate. At model size 2, \code{y ~ x1 + x2} and \code{y ~ x1 + x3} would be the
two candidates. At the last model size of 3, \code{y ~ x1 + x2 + x3} would be
the only candidate. As another example, to exclude \code{x1} from the search,
specify \code{search_terms = c("x2", "x3", "x2 + x3")} (or, in a simpler way
that leads to the same results, \code{search_terms = c("x2", "x3")}).
}
\note{
If \code{validate_search} is \code{FALSE}, the search is not included in the CV
so that only a single full-data search is run. If the number of
observations is large, the fast PSIS-LOO-CV along the full-data search path
is likely to be accurate. If the number of observations is small or
moderate, the fast PSIS-LOO-CV along the full-data search path is likely to
have optimistic bias in the middle of the search path. This result can be
used to guide further actions and the optimistic bias can be greatly
reduced by using \code{validate_search = TRUE}.

PSIS uses the Pareto-\eqn{\hat{k}} diagnostic to assess the reliability of
PSIS-LOO-CV. Global option \code{projpred.warn_psis} (default \code{TRUE}) controls
whether the Pareto-\eqn{\hat{k}} diagnostics may result in warnings. See
\link[loo:loo-glossary]{loo::loo-glossary} for how to interpret the Pareto-\eqn{\hat{k}} values
and the warning thresholds. \pkg{projpred} does not support the usually
recommended moment-matching (see \code{\link[loo:loo_moment_match]{loo::loo_moment_match()}} and
\code{\link[brms:loo_moment_match.brmsfit]{brms::loo_moment_match()}}), mixture importance sampling
(\code{vignette("loo2-mixis", package="loo")}), or \code{reloo}-ing
(\code{\link[brms:reloo.brmsfit]{brms::reloo()}}). If the reference model PSIS-LOO-CV Pareto-\eqn{\hat{k}}
values are good, but there are high Pareto-\eqn{\hat{k}} values for the
projected models, you can try increasing the number of draws used for the
PSIS-LOO-CV (\code{ndraws} in case of \code{refit_prj = FALSE}; \code{ndraws_pred} in case
of \code{refit_prj = TRUE}). If increasing the number of draws does not help and
if the reference model PSIS-LOO-CV Pareto-\eqn{\hat{k}} values are high,
and the reference model PSIS-LOO-CV results change substantially when using
moment-matching, mixture importance sampling, or \code{reloo}-ing, we recommend
to use \eqn{K}-fold-CV within \code{projpred}.

For PSIS-LOO-CV, \pkg{projpred} calls \code{\link[loo:psis]{loo::psis()}} (or, exceptionally,
\code{\link[loo:sis]{loo::sis()}}, see below) with \code{r_eff = NA}. This is only a problem if there
was extreme autocorrelation between the MCMC iterations when the reference
model was built. In those cases however, the reference model should not
have been used anyway, so we don't expect \pkg{projpred}'s \code{r_eff = NA} to
be a problem.

PSIS cannot be used if the number of draws or clusters is too small. In
such cases, \pkg{projpred} resorts to standard importance sampling (SIS)
and shows a message about this. Throughout the documentation, the term
"PSIS" is used even though in fact, \pkg{projpred} resorts to SIS in these
special cases. If SIS is used, check that the reference model PSIS-LOO-CV
Pareto-\eqn{\hat{k}} values are good.

With \code{parallel = TRUE}, costly parts of \pkg{projpred}'s CV can be run in
parallel. Costly parts are the fold-wise searches and performance
evaluations in case of \code{validate_search = TRUE}. (Note that in case of
\eqn{K}-fold CV, the \eqn{K} reference model refits are not affected by
argument \code{parallel}; only \pkg{projpred}'s CV is affected.) The
parallelization is powered by the \pkg{foreach} package. Thus, any parallel
(or sequential) backend compatible with \pkg{foreach} can be used, e.g.,
the backends from packages \pkg{doParallel}, \pkg{doMPI}, or
\pkg{doFuture}. For GLMs, this CV parallelization should work reliably, but
for other models (such as GLMMs), it may lead to excessive memory usage
which in turn may crash the R session (on Unix systems, setting an
appropriate memory limit via \code{\link[unix:rlimit]{unix::rlimit_as()}} may avoid crashing the
whole machine). However, the problem of excessive memory usage is less
pronounced for the CV parallelization than for the projection
parallelization described in \link{projpred-package}. In that regard, the CV
parallelization is recommended over the projection parallelization.
