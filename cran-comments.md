## Test environments

* Local:
    + R version 4.1.3 (2022-03-10) on Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS system (platform:
      x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit))
* win-builder:
    + R-devel (R version 4.2.0 alpha (2022-04-01 r82059 ucrt))
    + R-release (R version 4.1.3 (2022-03-10))
    + R-oldrelease (R version 4.0.5 (2021-03-31))

## R CMD check results

The local checks gave no ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs.

For all three win-builder checks, we get a NOTE at
`checking CRAN incoming feasibility ...`:

* On R-devel and R-release, this NOTE reads:

As can be seen above, the URLs reported as inaccessible are created from DOIs.
In fact, these URLs are accessible (just like the DOIs themselves), so we think
this can be safely ignored.
